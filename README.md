# MinecraftMod
This is a Minecraft mod for 1.16.1 i'm working on and hope to complete

By then end it should have: 
1. Kyber Crystals - Found in the nether at the bottom of lava lakes - Are white originally but you can dye them to produce different colours
2. Lightsabers - Made with a dyed kyber crystals and titanium/glass - 20 Attack Damage and Unbreakable but only usable with a Jedi Robe. 
3. List of Ores:
  Iron
  Coal
  Gold (Buffed)
  Diamond - remains the same.
  Netherite - temporary resistance to fire damage and take less damage from all nether mo
  Titanium - Found in the end - used to make Endite with Obsidian. 
  Kyber - used to make lightsabers and health boosts
  Endite (wip name) - used to upgrade elytra and diamond gear. Slightly more protection than Netherite and higher enchantability.
  Obsidian - Used to make endite.
  Spectrite - Used to make Spectre armor, which provides the ability to use magic weapons. 
  Ruby - Used for magic weapons.
  Emerald - Can be used as a weaker alternative for magic weapons/healing magic weapons.
4. There are now 'classes' aka "magic" weapons and more ranged options.
5. Elytra have been buffed with an upgrade - more durability/a short time to fly up - combined with an Endite chestplate.
6. Jedi Robe - slightly less protection than leather armor. Wearing this will allow you to use the lightsaber.		
7. Health boost - Made with kyber and a notch apple. Permanantely increases your hp by 1 heart. Maximum of 10 uses.
